I did this for [@angry__snail](https://twitter.com/@angry__snail )'s [#RandomPlacesChallenge](https://twitter.com/hashtag/RandomPlacesChallenge?src=hashtag_click). I did it using no colors and then picture the proper hue + did corrections afterwards. It was pretty cool working like this and I'm quite happy with the result :)
