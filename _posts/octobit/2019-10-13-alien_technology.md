These are the rings from Contact, one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies. 

Now, the actual spin cycles of the rings is a lot different from what I ended up drew. Given the time constraints, though, I was able to achieve a fairly chaotic animation (albeit not as chaotic as the real one) by simply using uneven animation cycles (IOW, each ring's animation starts at a different frame, which gives a nice effect of a never-ending animation when it's in reality just 8 frames).
